The dealer is in charge of running all aspects of the game, from shuffling and dealing the cards to handling all bets.

In this game,maximum number of players is 5

1) THE PACK:
In this game 4 standard 52-card pack is used

2) OBJECT OF THE GAME:
Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

3) CARD VALUES/SCORING:
It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value.

4) BETTING:
Before the deal begins, each player places a bet.

5) THE DEAL:
When all the players have placed their bets, the dealer gives one card face up to each player in rotation clockwise, and then one card face up to themselves. Another round of cards is then dealt face up to each player, but the dealer takes the second card face down. Thus, each player except the dealer receives two cards face up,and the dealer receives one card face up and one card face down.

6) NATURALS:
If a player's first two cards are an ace and a "ten-card" (a picture card or 10), giving a count of 21 in two cards, this is a natural or "blackjack." If any player has a natural and the dealer does not, the dealer immediately pays the player one and a half times the amount of their bet.If the dealer and the player both have naturals, the bet of that player is a stand-off (a tie), and the player takes back his bet amount.

If the dealer's face-up card is a ten-card or an ace, they look at their face-down card to see if the two cards make a natural. If the face-up card is not a ten-card or an ace, they do not  look at the face-down card until it is the dealer's turn to play.

7) THE PLAY:
The player to the left goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card) or "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly). Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt to them, or they may ask the dealer for additional cards, one at a time, until deciding to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under), or goes "bust" (if it is over 21). In the latter case, the player loses and the dealer collects the bet wagered. The dealer then turns to the next player to their left and serves them in the same manner.

The combination of an ace with a card other than a ten-card is known as a "soft hand," because the player can count the ace as a 1 or 11, and either draw cards or not. For example with a "soft 17" (an ace and a 6), the total is 7 or 17. While a count of 17 is a good hand, the player may wish to draw for a higher total. If the draw creates a bust hand by counting the ace as an 11, the player simply counts the ace as a 1 and continues playing by standing or "hitting" (asking the dealer for additional cards, one at a time).

8) THE DEALER'S PLAY:
When the dealer has served every player, the dealers face-down card is turned up. If the total is 17 or more, it must stand. If the total is 16 or under, they must take a card. The dealer must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand. If the dealer has an ace, and counting it as 11 would bring the total to 17 or more (but not over 21), the dealer must count the ace as 11 and stand. The dealer's decisions, then, are automatic on all plays, whereas the player always has the option of taking one or more cards.

9) SPLITTING PAIRS:
If a player's first two cards are of the same denomination, such as two jacks or two sixes, they may choose to treat them as two separate hands when their turn comes around. The amount of the original bet then goes on one of the cards, and an equal amount must be placed as a bet on the other card. The player first plays the hand to their left by standing or hitting one or more times; only then is the hand to the right played. The two hands are thus treated separately,and the dealer settles with each on its own merits. With a pair of aces, the player is given one card for each ace and may not draw again. Also, if a ten-card is dealt to one of these aces, the payoff is equal to the bet (not one and one-half to one, as with a blackjack at any other time).Note that Players are not allowed to split a hand or insure one or two hands which had already splitted.

10) DOUBLING DOWN
Another option open to the player is doubling their bet when the original two cards dealt total 9, 10, or 11. When the player's turn comes, they place a bet equal to the original bet, and the dealer gives the player just one card. With doubling down,the player is just allowed to play the hand in the regular way. Note that the dealer does not have the option of splitting or doubling down.
Note:If the first two cards is a pair of 5s, the player has option of either to split or double down.In this case, only doubling down is considered since it is favourable to player than splitting.

11) INSURANCE
When the dealer's face-up card is an ace, any of the players may make a side bet of up to half the original bet that the dealer's face-down card is a ten-card,and thus a blackjack for the house. Once all such side bets are placed, the dealer looks at the hole card. If it is a ten-card, it is turned up, and those players  who have made the insurance bet win and are paid double the amount of their half-bet - a 2 to 1 payoff. When a blackjack occurs for the dealer, of course, the  hand is over, and the players' main bets are collected - unless a player also has blackjack, in which case it is a stand-off.A player can also split or double down even after making a insurance.

12) SETTLEMENT
A bet once paid and collected is never returned. If the player goes bust, they have already lost their wager, even if the dealer goes bust as well. If the dealer goes over 21, the dealer pays each player who has stood the amount of that player's bet.If the dealer stands at 21 or less, the dealer pays the bet of any player having a higher total (not exceeding 21) and collects the bet of any player having a lower total. If there is a stand-off (a player having the same total as the dealer), no chips are paid out or collected.
